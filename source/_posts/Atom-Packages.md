Did you know that [Atom](https://atom.io/) is one of the best text editors out there?

Atom is an open source, platform independent text editor built by GitHub. It has a great ecosystem of packages which extend the capabilities of Atom to a great extent. Packages are super simple to install using the in-built atom package manager - `apm`. And did I mention that its free? Yes, its free!

Atom ships with a minimal set of packages. Here are a few packages that you must download to code like a pro:

1. [Emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet):
Emmet is a plugin that should be installed, irrespective of the text editor/IDE you use. It makes writing HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS so much easier and faster. The syntax is pretty intuitive and very easy to catch on. Here's the official [Emmet cheat sheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/). A must have package!

2. [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments):
I feel that managing CSS is a pain in the ass. Trying to visualize color codes just adds to that. Pigments displays the colors in your project files and give you a good idea of what's its going to look like.

3. [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap):
Minimap displays a mini preview of your file on the right/left hand side of your editor. This one is ripped off from Sublime Text. Useful though!

4. [File Icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons):
File Icons improves the visual appearance of your project. It assigns file icons to different types of files to improve visual appearance.

5. [Beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify):
This package beautifies the code that you have written. It corrects the indentation and the spacing. This package also supports multiple languages.

6. [Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server):
For me, this is by far the most useful plugin for web development. It saves me from refreshing the browser 100 times to see the output. Again, a must have package!

7. [CSS Comb](https://atom.io/packages/atom-csscomb):
This package sorts the CSS properties in a CSS/SASS/LESS file. Pretty famous among clean coders!

8. [Merge Conflict](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts):
This package resolves git merge conflicts through Atom. I wonder why GitHub didn't ship this plugin with Atom in the first place.

9. [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter):
A basic linter for your javascript files. There are many other linters available. Pick what you like the most.

10. [Activate Power Mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode):
Sometimes, only activating power mode can save you. This package was made for trying times. Activate power mode and code your problems away! :D


Atom has lots of other useful plugins. Let me know which ones you like the most!
