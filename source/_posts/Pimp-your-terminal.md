Your bare bones - out of the box terminal is good. It does what it is supposed to do. But you can pimp it out to look like the one that you see above in just a few steps! This upgrade brings a lot of extra features and displays very useful Git info and it's surprisingly simple to achieve. All you have to do is these 3 things:

1. Install [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
2. Install [ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/)
3. Install a [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) and this awesome [theme](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm).

I made the change recently and I am definitely not going back! Let me know what you guys think!
